## About Human Machine Interaction (HMI)

During my master\'s studies in Computer science at UNIBZ, I did my
project as a laboratory team member in HCI ([Human-machine
interaction](https://github.com/HeiderJeffer/Human-Machine-Interaction))
with my supervisor [Professor Gennari
Rosella](https://www.unibz.it/en/faculties/engineering/academic-staff/person/8607-rosella-gennari),
with main research area Main Research Areas: Human-Computer Interaction,
Interaction Design, Tangible Design, and Making Technology Enhanced
Learning, We did the following:

-   From child data, we implement HCI models to process and extract
    child persona(s), Each student has analyzed one particular child.
    After discussing together, we decided on the criteria to split the
    two skeletons. (classifying and layering work has been done in the
    class together. The outcome is:\
    Persona 1: (Child: Interests/activities, Social skills, Computer
    usage) VS Persona 2: (Child: Interests/activities, Social skills,
    Computer usage).

-   Blank HTA: Simple Plan For Purchasing A Song

-   HTA for Searching: Searching for a Safari Tech e-book At UniBZ
    Website

-   Context Scenario: Underline, Explain, And Rewrite the Context
    Scenario.

-   Data analysis: Highlight the Goal (persona's main task), Examine the
    First-Level Tasks, and Build an HTA

-   HTA Textual Analysis and Graphical Analysis

-   Designing LEVEL #1, #2, and 3# Wireframe (web type prototype).

-   Calculated confidence interval and discuss results

-   Calculated the (likely average)

-   Identifying the Distribution of the Data

-   Calculate the critical value and degree of the freedom

-   Designing (Usability Metrics and Analysis)

-   Using the [Adjusted Wald
    Method](https://measuringu.com/calculators/wald/) to compute the
    following values: ([Best
    Estimate](https://measuringu.com/calculators/wald/#bestest),
    [MLE](https://measuringu.com/calculators/wald/#maxlike),
    [LaPlace](https://measuringu.com/calculators/wald/#laplace_est),
    [Jeffrey\'s](https://measuringu.com/calculators/wald/#jeff_est), and
    [Wilson](https://measuringu.com/calculators/wald/#wilson_est)).

-   Design a Matrix for Design Methods, Task Measure, Orders, and Page
    Styles.

-   Design a model to identify the dissimilarity: cognitive
    walkthrough - carousel, the effort for the task - success on task,
    minimalism, aesthetics design wire-framing, and card sorting - tree
    sorting.

-   Calculate the UX and struggle to end the task.
